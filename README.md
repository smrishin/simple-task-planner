## üîß Local Development

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smrishin/simple-task-planner.git
   cd task-manager-next
   ```
2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a .env.local file and add:

```env
SIMPLE_TASK_PLANNER_STORAGE_KV_REST_API_URL=<your-upstash-url>
SIMPLE_TASK_PLANNER_STORAGE_KV_REST_API_TOKEN=<your-upstash-token>
ACCESS_CODE=your-secret-code
```

4. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üåê Deployment on Vercel

1. Push the project to GitHub.

2. Import the repo into Vercel.

3. Add Upstash Redis from the Vercel Marketplace.

4. Vercel injects storage env vars automatically:

   - SIMPLE_TASK_PLANNER_STORAGE_KV_REST_API_URL

   - SIMPLE_TASK_PLANNER_STORAGE_KV_REST_API_TOKEN

5. Add your own access code:

   - ACCESS_CODE=your-secret-code

6. Redeploy, then access your app at the Vercel-provided domain.

## üîê Access Protection

This app requires a secret access code (set via env vars).
Users must enter the correct code to unlock the app; until then:

- No pages are accessible

- No DB reads/writes are made
